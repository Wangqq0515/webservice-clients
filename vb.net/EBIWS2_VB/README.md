# EBI Web Services Visual Basic .NET Sample Clients

Sample clients for a selection of EMBL-EBI SOAP web services implemented in
Visual Basic .NET.

This is a Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 Express solution.

## Service Stubs

Due to issues with the Mono versions of `wsdl.exe` (see Notes) the required
service stubs have been generated using the Microsoft SDK and checked-in to
the repository. To regenerate, open an Microsoft SDK environment CMD window,
change to the root directory of the solution and enter:

```
cd EbiWS
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk clean-stubs
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk stubs
```

The resulting WebReference\*\Reference.vb files will be used in subsequent
compiles.

## Building

For Mono environments (assumes vbnc is on the path). Build with make:
```
make -f Makefile.mono
```

or with xbuild using the MonoDevelop/Visual Studio solution:

```
xbuild EBIWS2_VB.sln
```

For builds using the Microsoft SDK, open a CMD window with the SDK
environment. To build with make:

```
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk
```

or with msbuild using the MonoDevelop/Visual Studio solution:

```
msbuild EBIWS2_VB.sln
```

## Notes

A. Issues observed in Mono environments.

1. Mono 2.4 (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) fails to generate stubs ("Web References")
using `wsdl.exe` or `wsdl2.exe` with a error relating to WS-I Basic Profile
check R2305. This issue has been reported as a Mono bug, see:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=569533, and appears to be fixed
in more recent versions (e.g. 2.6.7) although they now incorrectly report that
the services fail the R2305 compliance check (confirmed with the WS-I tools).

2. While the project builds with Mono 2.x, when using MS SDK generated stubs,
the clients do not work due to the web service calls all returning null.
Strangely the equivalent sample clients C# work as expected in these versions,
suggesting that this is caused by a problem in the Mono VB.NET implementation.
MS VB.NET compiled clients work as expected, confirming that this is a
compiler issue.

3. Generation of client stubs ("Web References") for the document/literal
wrapper SOAP services using Mono 2.6 `wsdl.exe/wsdl2.exe` generates VB code
which fails to compile.

4. Generation of client stubs ("Service References") for the document/literal
wrapper SOAP services using Mono 2.6 `svcutil.exe` also generates VB code which
fails to compile.

5. Provided code will not compile with the Mono 1.2 VB.NET implementation.
The code uses "Next varName" to close "For" loops and this is not supported
by the VB compiler used in Mono 1.2. Commenting out the 'varName' will allow
to compile to complete, However the produced clients do not function
correctly.

Workaround:
To create clients that work on both MS .NET and Mono environments, compile
the project on MS Windows using the MS SDK or Visual Studio. The generated
.dll and .exe files can then be used on both platforms. Alternatively, since
the same API is used, the `EbiWS.dll` from the C# project can be used with the
VB.NET .exe files to produce working clients.
