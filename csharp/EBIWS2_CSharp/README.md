C# .NET Sample Clients
----------------------

Sample clients for a selection of EMBL-EBI SOAP web services implemented in
C# for .NET.

## Service Stubs

Due to issues with the Mono versions of wsdl.exe (see Notes) the required
service stubs have been generated using the Microsoft SDK and checked-in to
the repository. To regenerate, open an Microsoft SDK environment CMD window,
change to the root directory of the solution and enter:

```
cd EbiWS
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk clean-stubs
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk stubs
```

The resulting WebReference\*\Reference.cs files will be used in subsequent
compiles.

## Building

For Mono environments (assumes gmcs is on the path). Build with make:

```
make -f Makefile.mono
```

or with xbuild using the MonoDevelop/Visual Studio solution:

```
xbuild EBIWS2_CSharp.sln
```

For builds using the Microsoft SDK, open a CMD window with the SDK environment
and change to the root directory of the solution. Then to build with make:

```
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk
```

or using msbuild to compile the MonoDevelop/Visual Studio solution:

```
msbuild EBIWS2_CSharp.sln
```

### Notes

A. Issues observed in Mono environments.

1. Mono 2.4 (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) fails to generate stubs ("Web References")
using wsdl.exe or wsdl2.exe with a error relating to WS-I Basic Profile
check R2305. This issue has been reported as a Mono bug, see:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=569533, and appears to be fixed
in more recent versions (e.g. 2.6.7) although they now incorrectly (confirmed
with the WS-I tools) report that the services fail the R2305 compliance check.

2. Generation of client stubs ("Web References") for the document/literal
wrapper SOAP services using Mono 2.6 wsdl.exe/wsdl2.exe generates code
which fails to compile correctly. Some of the types are incorrectly generated.
