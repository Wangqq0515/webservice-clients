EBI Web Services .NET C# Clients
--------------------------------

A set of sample EBI Web Services clients developed in C# for .NET environments.

See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/

## Development Platform

The code base is packaged as a Visual Studio 2005 solution. This is
importable into Visual Studio 2008, and usable in MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop.

The solution contains a number of projects:

* EbiWS: core clients library
* EBeyeCliClient: Command-line client for the EB-eye service.
* FastaCliClient: Command-line client for the FASTA service.
* NcbiBlastCliClient: Command-line client for the NCBI BLAST service.
* WuBlastCliClient: Command-line client for the WU-BLAST service.

## Building Clients

The solution can be built using an IDE which understands Visual Studio
2005 solutions/projects, for example MonoDevelop, SharpDevelop or Visual
Studio (including Express).

The Microsoft Build Engine (MSBUILD) or the open source xbuild
(http://www.mono-project.com/Microsoft.Build) can also be able to build the
solution and its projects.

For plain .NET SDK and Mono environments a set of make files are
provided for MS Windows and Linux which can be invoked as follows:

*MS .NET SDK*
From the SDK "CMD Shell"
```
nmake -f Makefile.ms_sdk
```

*Mono*
From a terminal
```
make -f Makefile.mono
```

## Running Clients

For the command-line clients, open a shell window and directly run the
exe: `NcbiBlastCliClient.exe`

On Mono based environments it may be necessary to call 'mono' to run
the exe: `mono NcbiBlastCliClient.exe`

## Packaging Clients

The projects generate a core dll (`EbiWS.dll`) and a set of command-line clients
which depend on this dll. To make distribution and installation easier the
clients in the bin/ directory are processed using monomerge.exe
(http://evain.net/blog/articles/2006/11/06/an-introduction-to-mono-merge) to
create single exe files which include the dll code. A makefile
(bin/Makefile.mono) to perform this task is provided. A similar task can be
performed on MS Windows using ILMerge
(http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ilmerge.aspx).
